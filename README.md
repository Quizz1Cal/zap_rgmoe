# zap.rgmoe

This package was created as part of my Master's thesis at the University of Melbourne. ZAP-RGMoE is an extension of the Z-value adaptive procedure (ZAP) ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12623)) that uses regularised Gaussian Mixture-of-Experts for multiple testing with continuous covariates, or Z-values. Please see the attached paper for further details.
